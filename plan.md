# Planning

## Overall Goals
To introduce all collaborators to beginner robotics projects.
- The mechanical and electrical designs will be made out of components found on the internet and in stores.
- The project will be as realistic as needed and (hopefully) will end as a displayed product.
- PyBullet will be used to simulate the entire approximated system for export.

### Outputs
- Ready to use Arduino Code
- A technical manual/documentation that describes the function and usage of all components
- An assembly manual/diagram
- (Hopefully) A Blender animation
