# Schedule


## March 26th
Hopefully finish the wheels and find DC motor models to put into the project.

## March 27th
Choose microcontroller, and motor drivers (possibly start writing code for the simulator)

## March 28th
Find model of microcontroller, motor drivers and breadboard/prototype board for electronics.

## March 29th
Model the enclosure/cart

## March 30th
Model the pendulum and how it connects to the enclosure/cart

## March 31st
Its a holiday so break I guess or work on the next thing.

## April 1st
Put everything together in an Assembly with the tracks (The table doesn't have to be modelled)

## April 2nd
Start arduino simulation in Python (or if its written in C, start making the electornics instead)

## April 3rd
Hopefully finish Arduino simulation in Python (or if its written in C, finish making the electornics instead)

## April 4th
Start learning PyBullet and making URDF files for the robot

## April 5th
Finish the URDF files

## April 6th
Start Simulating the system in PyBullet and messing around for testing

## April 7th
Make a PID controller in Python to work with PyBullet

## April 8th
Using the simulator for arduino and the electronics -> write arduino code that does the PID control

## April 9th
Programmatically find the performance specifications of the system (how fast it goes... etc)

## April 10th 
Technical writing on the project (maybe just an overview but if there's time maybe an assembly manual?)

## April 11th
Technical writing on the project (maybe just an overview but if there's time maybe an assembly manual?)

## April 12th and onward I guess
That's pretty much it. If anything can be made to a higher degree or increasing the complexity of the system, the project will continue.
