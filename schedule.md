# Schedule


## March 26th
Hopefully finish the wheels and find DC motor models to put into the project.

## March 27th
Choose microcontroller, and motor drivers

## March 28th
Find model of microcontroller, motor drivers and breadboard/prototype board for electronics.

## March 29th
Model the enclosure/cart

## March 30th
Model the pendulum and how it connects to the enclosure/cart

## March 31st
Its a holiday so break I guess or work on the next thing.

## April 1st
Put everything together in an Assembly with the tracks (The table doesn't have to be modelled)

## April 2nd
Start designing the electronics circuit

## April 3rd
Finish Designing the electronics circuit (if it only takes one day then start learning pybullet).

## April 4th
Start learning PyBullet and making URDF files for the robot

## April 5th
Finish the URDF files

## April 6th
Start Simulating the system in PyBullet and messing around for testing

## April 7th
Make a PID controller in Python to work with PyBullet

## April 8th
Write arduino code that does the PID control from the PyBullet sim code.

## April 9th
Programmatically find the performance specifications of the system (how fast it goes... etc)

## April 10th 
Technical writing on the project (maybe just an overview but if there's time maybe an assembly manual?)

## April 11th
Technical writing on the project (maybe just an overview but if there's time maybe an assembly manual?)

## April 12th and onward I guess
That's pretty much it. If anything can be made to a higher degree or increasing the complexity of the system, the project will continue.
